# What Is The Shell?

The **shell**  is a program that takes keyboard commands and passes them to the 
operating system to carry out. Basically when we use the terminal.

When we start a terminal emulator we can see something like:

[me@linuxbox ~]$ 

This is called a **shell prompt** and it will appear whenever the shell is ready
to accept input.

## Simple commands

```bash

date # Displays the current time and date
uptime # With this command we can see how long the system has been running
df # To see the current amount of free space on our disk drives
free # To display the amount of free memory
exit --> We can end the terminal session. Also, we can use Ctrl + d

We can access to a virtual console using Ctrl-Alt-F6 and we can return 
to our graphical desktop pressing Ctrl-Alt-F1
