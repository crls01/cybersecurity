## Why I'm learning Linux

Learning Linux is not just a technical requirement. It's a foundational step
 toward my future in Red Team operations and ethical hacking. Mastering the 
terminal, permissions, processes, and file structures gives me the power
 to understand systems inside out.

This journey starts here, and I'm documenting every step to share, revisit 
and grow from it.
